# LSG-CPD
This repo contains the matlab implementation of CPD with Local Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD).

## Introduction
CPD with Local Surface Geometry is a probabilistic rigid registration method.
Compared to the original CPD (Link to CPD paper), it takes into account the local surface geometry in the construction of the Gaussian mixture models (GMM).

## Installation
1. Install Matlab
2. Install the following matlab toolbox
..- Computer Vision Toolbox
..- Parallel Computing Toolbox
..- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Usage
1. Outlier Experiment


## TODO
1. Demo for multi-view object modeling
2. Demo for Stanford Lounge dataset

We are also working on implementing the method on C++. Stay tuned.
